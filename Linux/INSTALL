Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `qmake XXX.pro' to produce Makefile.  

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  

  4. The software requires some shared object files, including libqsqlpsql.so, libpq.so,
     libQt5Core, and libQt5Sql. The lib subdirectory contains libpq.so, libQt5Core.so, 
     libQt5Sql.so and linked files. Sqldrivers contains the libqsqlpsql.so file.
     You can recompile all the files, but keep the structure of the bin directory,
     otherwise you will have to change the PRO file to reflect the new state.
