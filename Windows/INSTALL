Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `qmake -o Makefile XXX.pro' to produce Makefile.  

  2. Type `mingw32_make' to compile the package.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `mingw32_make clean'.  

  4. The software requires some DLL files, including libcrypto-1_1.dll, libpq.dll,
     libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll, libssl-1_1.dll, libstdc++-6.dll, libwinpthread-1.dll,
	 Qt5Core.dll, and Qt5Sql.dll. The Sqldrivers subdirectory contains the qsqlpsql.dll file.
     You can recompile all the files, but keep the structure of the bin directory,
     otherwise you will have to change the PRO file to reflect the new state.
