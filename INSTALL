Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

--------------------------------On Linux---------------------------------------------------------
  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `qmake HydrusExecuteTool.pro' to produce Makefile.  

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make distclean'.  

  4. The software requires some shared object files, including libqsqlpsql.so, libpq.so,
     libQt5Core, and libQt5Sql. The lib subdirectory contains libpq.so, libQt5Core.so, 
     libQt5Sql.so, libqsqlpsql.so and linked files. You can recompile all the files, 
     but keep the structure of the bin directory, otherwise you will have to change 
     the PRO file to reflect the new state.

---------------------------------On Windows------------------------------------------------------
1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `qmake -o Makefile HydrusExecuteTool.pro' to produce Makefile.  

  2. Type `mingw32_make' to compile the package.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `mingw32_make distclean'.  

  4. The software requires some DLL files, including libcrypto-1_1.dll, libpq.dll,
     libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll, libssl-1_1.dll, libstdc++-6.dll, libwinpthread-1.dll,
	 Qt5Core.dll, Qt5Sql.dll and qsqlpsql.dll file.
     You can recompile all the files, but keep the structure of the bin directory,
     otherwise you will have to change the PRO file to reflect the new state.
